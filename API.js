    article: 'In the previous article we learn the basics of HTML , but in this lesson we will be up to a higher degree because we will learn how to think of creating sites before we begin with actual programming . <br> And this point is very important because the most of beginners in this field face difficulties in this idea because they are not ability to imagine the final form of the project . So , we will learn how to think... , but this skill develops over time and increased experience . <br> <br> First when you wont to build a website you should to think about the benefits of this poject , then you can start thinking about the form and design of this site . And I advise you to inspire of some similar sites that has the same content you would to make about . <br> As example when you wont to build a personal website to apply on a job , here you see the closest appropriate examples for your choice and collect ideas and designs you like , but you should not try the same design you liked accurately ; because you can add your own thouches maked the traditional design vibrant and custom for you and you will feel frustrated because you were not creative , so you have to think allot about the project before start coding . <br> <br> This lesson has finished. You can continue the next lesson using this link <a href="./lesson3.html">ðŸ‘‰ Lesson 3 ðŸ‘ˆ</a>',
